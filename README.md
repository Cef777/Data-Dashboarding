# DepEd Enrolment Data Dashboarding

##Project Description
A data visualization and analysis initiative focused on the Department of Education (DepEd) enrolment data. This project addresses the agency's need for real-time insights by transforming static enrolment figures into an interactive dashboard for informed policy-making and planning.

##Description of Dataset Used
The dataset consists of official enrolment records from the Department of Education’s Learner Information System (LIS). It captures data across various education levels: Kindergarten, Elementary (Grades 1–6), Junior High School (Grades 7–10), and Senior High School (Grades 11–12), along with SHS track preferences and gender disaggregation.

##Questions KPI
Key questions addressed:
What is the distribution of enrolment across education levels?
Where are the biggest drop-off points in the learner pipeline?
How do SHS track preferences vary by gender?
Key performance indicators (KPIs):
Total Enrollees by Grade Level and Year
Drop-off Points and Transitions (G6→G7, G10→SHS)
SHS Track Distribution by Gender
Regional Variations in Enrolment
