# DepEd Enrolment Data Dashboarding

## Project Description

- A data visualization and analysis initiative focused on the Department of Education (DepEd) enrolment data. This project addresses the agency's need for real-time insights by transforming static enrolment figures into an interactive dashboard for informed policy-making and planning.

## Description of Dataset Used

- The dataset consists of official enrolment records from the Department of Education‚Äôs Learner Information System (LIS). It captures data across various education levels: Kindergarten, Elementary (Grades 1‚Äì6), Junior High School (Grades 7‚Äì10), and Senior High School (Grades 11‚Äì12), along with SHS track preferences and gender disaggregation.

## Questions KPI

- Key questions addressed:
  What is the distribution of enrolment across education levels?
  Where are the biggest drop-off points in the learner pipeline?
  How do SHS track preferences vary by gender?
- Key performance indicators (KPIs):
  Total Enrollees by Grade Level and Year
  Drop-off Points and Transitions (G6‚ÜíG7, G10‚ÜíSHS)
  SHS Track Distribution by Gender
  Regional Variations in Enrolment

## Process

1. Data Understanding
- Familiarized with LIS structure and DepEd workflows
- Identified crucial variables for enrolment tracking
2. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data
- Standardized column names and values
- Built a data dictionary
3. Data Analysis
- Identified drop-off trends and track preferences
- Gender-based and grade-level comparison
4. Dashboard Development
- Designed intuitive filters and logical layout
- Implemented real-time slicers by year, region, grade level, and track
- Ensured accurate aggregation and responsive performance

## Project Insight
1. üè´ Elementary Education Still Dominates (55%)
- Majority of enrollees are in Elementary (~15M)
- Significant drop in enrolment from Elementary to SHS
- Implication: Many learners do not complete basic education
  
 **Recommendations:**
- Strengthen Grade 6‚Äì7 transition
- Introduce conditional cash incentives
- Develop bridging programs

2. üìâ Consistent Decline Across Grade Levels
- Steady Elementary enrolment, major attrition post-G6 and G10
- Implication: Learners face multiple barriers transitioning between levels
  
  **Recommendations:**
- Career orientation starting Grade 5
- Enhance G10 exit support programs
- Address regional barriers: accessibility, family pressure, etc.

3. üßë‚Äçüè≠ SHS Track Preferences
- Top Track: TVL (Technical-Vocational-Livelihood)

  **Trends:**
- HUMSS popular with females
- STEM balanced gender-wise
- ARTS, SPORTS under-enrolled
  
 **Recommendations:**
- Equip TVL labs and certify instructors
- Promote under-enrolled tracks with scholarships and infrastructure
- Align tracks with labor market needs

## Final Conclusion
- This project successfully highlights the value of data-driven governance in the Philippine education sector. The interactive dashboard enables DepEd personnel and policymakers to quickly identify enrolment trends, drop-off points, and track disparities‚Äîsupporting strategic planning and resource allocation. With a reliable and intuitive tool, DepEd can now shift from reactive to proactive education management.
